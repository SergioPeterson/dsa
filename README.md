# Data Structure and Algorithms in Python

This repository has some of the data structures and algorithms I implemented throughout the
semesters and internships. Feel free to use as you like, but keep in mind that bugs might be discovered. 

## Speaking of which, found one?
 * Clone or fork and send me a pull request, thanks!
